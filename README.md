# Ethereum_Illegal_transactions_ML
Buiding ML model to detect Illegal Accounts from ongoing Ethereum transactions in its mempool.
In this Capstone project we collected illegal transactions and legal transactions addresses from various sources and extracted 22 features corresponding these addresses. The features were related to all transactions, received and sent, Time taken for those transactions, averahe, minimum, maximum values and ERC20 transaction values over tiem.
Models Trained: 
  Logistic regression
  Random Forest
  Decision Tree
  DNN Keras Classifier
  Ensemble learning,
    Voting Classifier
    Stacking Classifier

We used two sets of dataset on which we trained and tested all the model and found individual accuaracies.We also did visualisation on the datasets which gave us insights on how each feature were contributing to identify illegal and legal transaction.
